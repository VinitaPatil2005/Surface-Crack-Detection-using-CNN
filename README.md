# Surface Crack Detection using CNN

A Deep Learning project that automatically detects cracks on concrete surfaces using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies images into **Crack** and **No Crack** categories, providing a simple and efficient solution for structural inspection.

---

## Overview

Manual inspection of concrete structures is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project uses a CNN model trained on concrete surface images to automate crack detection. The application also provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface for image upload and prediction.

## Features

- Binary image classification (Crack / No Crack)
- CNN model built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Image upload using Streamlit
- Prediction confidence score
- Model evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
- Modular project structure
- Clean and interactive user interface
